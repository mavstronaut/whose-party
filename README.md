whose party is it anyway? mario party + improv performance

- use svg or canvas to create a board and move overlaid characters across positions 
- roll dice to determine number of moves (and then update position)
- if landing on red square, blue square or green assign those roles
- switch cases for different queues
- within those queues roll a game roulette to decide what game will be played
- play game, determine "winner" and play another round.

- seed games for a 2v2, FFA and 1v3 situation
- provide different categories for games, starting with improv and music.
